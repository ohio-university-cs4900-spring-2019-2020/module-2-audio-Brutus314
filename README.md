In this module, you will start out in a relatively blank world.
An audio track will play on loop when the world is created.
If you move into the red spherical waypoint, a yellow sphere will spawn.
This sphere will move toward you at about 0.3 units/frame.
Along with this sphere is a Pacman chomp sound effect.
